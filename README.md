# WEKA_ML_Framework
A framework of general classification machine learning based on WEKA
you can get info of weka from my blog:
http://blog.csdn.net/qiao1245/article/details/50803165
there are several artical about WEKA which can help your learning and using

* contains many kind of ML algorithm, random forest, naivebayes, SVM, adaboost,etc
* some tools helping you cleaning data, save and reload models, sampling,etc
* easy to expand

## File introduce
1. DataHelper   help you prepare training and testing data
2. MLModels     model factory, plenty of models can use, both extends MLModels
3. Parameters   interface of DataParameters, ModelParameters, which is your data's and models' parameter
4. MLUtils      utils helping you do data cleaning and model saving, file type convert, sampling
5. TrainMLModels train your models here

### if you think it's may useful for you, may you give me a star? :)
